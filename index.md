<p>
Endoscopy is a widely used clinical procedure for the early detection of numerous cancers (e.g., nasopharyngeal, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric, colorectal cancers, bladder cancer etc.), therapeutic procedures and minimally invasive surgery (e.g., laparoscopy). During this procedure an endoscope is used; a long, thin, rigid or flexible tube with a light source and camera at the tip to visualize the inside of affected organs on an external screen. Quantitative clinical endoscopy analysis is immensely challenging due to inevitable video frame quality degradation from various imaging artefacts to the non-planar geometries and deformations of organs.

<p>
<strong>Endo-CV is a crowd-sourcing initiative to promote foundational quantitative research in Endoscopy targeted towards promoting clinical translations through addressing key 'themes' of research.</strong>
</p>
<p>
 The core idea is that the initiators and each theme committee hold the research rights under the framework. We invite all interested people to join us and help us build a first comprehensive consortium that  promotes reproducible method development and facilitate clinical translation of  endoscopy. We invite both clinical and computational scientists to this network. The programme has a long term vision and is independant of institution.

##### Research Themes:
Currently we have designed four themes; <em>artefact detection</em>, <em>frame restoration</em>, <em>disease detection</em> and <em>3D reconstruction</em> which we believe are essential for successful analysis of complex endoscopy videos in the clinic. By no means is this a restrictive list! We encourage all with knowledge in this domain to contribute and work together with us to create a systematic plan to translation. Detailed information regarding the efforts can be found through the relevant links. As mentioned, this is intended to be a long-term vision. Currently we are addressing the themes through organisation of data challenges. To this end, we sucessfully identified, defined and tackled frame quality in endoscopy through artefact detection (<strong>Theme 1</strong>)
 
##### Theme 1: Endoscopy Artefact Detection (EAD)
